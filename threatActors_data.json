Operating a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting for affiliates in known cybercrime forums, offering to allow affiliates to leverage the ransomware and keep 80-90% of the ransom payment. The remainder would be paid to the BlackCat author.\n\nThe threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the 'BlackCat gang,' utilize numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space. Notably, they use multiple extortion techniques in some cases, including the siphoning of victim data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransom is not paid and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nKnown affiliates are:\n1.

Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails.  Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, \u201cth3bug\u201d is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.  Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native language.\n\nThis group could be related to Axiom, Group 72.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) The FBI issued a rare bulletin admitting that a group named Advanced Persistent Threat 6 (APT6) hacked into US government computer systems as far back as 2011 and for years stole sensitive data.\n\nThe FBI alert was issued in February and went largely unnoticed. Nearly a month later, security experts are now shining a bright light on the alert and the mysterious group behind the attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a rare alert and a little late, but one that is welcomed by all security vendors as it offers a chance to mitigate their customers and also collaborate further in what appears to be an ongoing FBI investigation,\u201d said Deepen Desai, director of security research at the security firm Zscaler in an email to Threatpost.\n\nDetails regarding the actual attack and what government systems were infected are scant. Government officials said they knew the initial attack occurred in 2011, but are unaware of who specifically is behind the attacks.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of malware payload involved and the duration of this compromise being unnoticed \u2013 the scope of lateral movement inside the compromised network is very high possibly exposing all the critical systems,\u201d Deepen said.",

       "description":"APT37 is a North Korean state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group has targeted victims primarily in South Korea, but also in Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Nepal, China, India, Romania, Kuwait, and other parts of the Middle East. APT37 has also been linked to the following campaigns between 2016-2018: Operation Daybreak, Operation Erebus, Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are you Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korean Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018.North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups.",

We have been tracking this activity under the codename AVIVORE.\n\nAffected victims include large multinational firms (Primes) and smaller engineering or consultancy firms within their supply chain (Secondaries). Context has worked closely with victims, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), security organisations, and law enforcement agencies across Europe to reduce impact and prevent further compromise.",

The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is tracking this threat actor as AeroBlade. The actor used spear-phishing as a delivery mechanism: A weaponized document, sent as an email attachment, contains an embedded remote template injection technique and a malicious VBA macro code, to deliver the next stage to the final payload execution.\n\nEvidence suggests that the attacker\u2019s network infrastructure and weaponization became operational around September 2022. BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the offensive phase of the attack occurred in July 2023. The attacker improved its toolset during that time, making it stealthier, while the network infrastructure remained the same.\n\nGiven the final payload functionality and the subject of the attack, BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the goal of this attack was commercial cyber espionage.",

       "description":"(Palo Alto) In March 2019, Unit 42 began looking into an attack campaign that appeared to be primarily focused on organizations within a Middle Eastern country. Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United States, and throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nOur analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template Injection. These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which ultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several related delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors used these TTPs throughout their attack campaign.\n\nInitially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the Gorgon Group. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs including the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators. Based on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.\n\nIn light of that, Unit 42 refers to the activity described in this blog as the Aggah Campaign based on the actor\u2019s alias \u201chagga\u201d, which was used to split data sent to the RevengeRAT C2 server and was the name of one of the Pastebin accounts used to host the RevengeRAT payloads.",

Akira uses compromised credentials to access single-factor external access mechanisms such as VPNs for initial access, then various publicly-available tools and techniques for lateral movement. Akira operations are associated with \"double extortion\"ransomware activity, where data is exfiltrated from victim environments prior to encryption, with threats to publish files if a ransom is not paid. Technical analysis of Akira ransomware indicates multiple overlaps with and similarities to Conti malware.",

The technical level and cautious attitude shown by this attacker during this activity are also worthy of attention.\n\nTherefore, NSFOCUS Security Labs identified the orchestrator of this event as a new attacker and named it AtlasCross.\n\nNSFOCUS Security Labs validated the high-level threat attributes of AtlasCross in terms of development technology and attack strategy through an in-depth analysis of its attack metrics. At this current stage, AtlasCross has a relatively limited scope of activity, primarily focusing on targeted attacks against specific hosts within a network domain. However, the attack processes they employ are highly robust and mature. NSFOCUS Security Labs deduce that this attacker is highly likely to deploy this attack process into larger-scale network attack operations.\n\nThe organizational origin of the AtlasCross attacker cannot be determined.",

       "description":"In December 2020, the IT management software provider SolarWinds announced that an unidentified threat actor had exploited a vulnerability in their Orion Platform software to deploy a web shell dubbed SUPERNOVA. CTU researchers track the operators of the SUPERNOVA web shell as BRONZE SPIRAL and assess with low confidence that the group is of Chinese origin. SUPERNOVA was likely deployed through exploitation of CVE-2020-10148, and CTU researchers observed post-exploitation reconnaissance commands roughly 30 minutes before the web shell was deployed. This may have been indicative of the threat actor conducting scan-and-exploit activity and then triaging for victims of particular interest, before deploying SUPERNOVA and attempting to dump credentials and move laterally.\n\nBRONZE SPIRAL has been associated with previous intrusions involving the targeting of ManageEngine servers, maintenance of long-term access to periodically harvest credentials and exfiltrate data, and espionage or theft of intellectual property. The threat group makes extensive use of native system tools and 'living off the land' techniques.",

       "description":"BRONZE VAPOR is a targeted threat group assessed with moderate confidence to be of Chinese origin. Artefacts from tools associated with this group and open source reporting on related incidents indicate that BRONZE VAPOR have operated since at least 2017.  The group conducts espionage against multiple industries including semiconductors, aviation and telecommunications.  CTU researchers assess BRONZE VAPOR's intent to be information theft, with operations focused on intellectual property (semiconductors) and personally identifiable information such as traveller records (aviation).  Compromise of telecommunications companies can yield personally identifiable information and meta data on client communications such as Call Data Records (CDR).\n\nPrior to 2019 their operational focus, with some exceptions, revolved around targets in East Asia particularity Taiwan with it's thriving semiconductor industry. In 2021 details emerged in open source of attacks on at least one European semiconductor company believed to date back to 2017.  In 2019 BRONZE VAPOR attacked one of more entities in the European airlines sector. The group gains initial access via VPN services, may use spearphishing with 'Letter of Appointment' themed lures, and deploys Cobalt Strike along with custom data exfiltration tools to target organizations.  Post-intrusion activity involves living-of-the-land using legitimate tools and commands available within victim environment as well as using AceHash for credential harvesting, WATERCYCLE for data exfiltration and STOCKPIPE for proxying information through Microsoft Exchange servers over email.\n\nBRONZE VAPOR uses a set of tactics that, although not individually unique, when viewed in aggregate create a relatively distinct playbook.  Intrusions begin with credential based attacks against an existing remote access solution (Citrix, VPN etc.) or B2B network access.  Cobalt Strike is deployed into the environment and further access is then conducted via Cobalt Strike Beacon and other features of the platform.  Sharphound is deployed to map out the victim's Active Directory infrastructure and and collect critical information about the domain including important account names.  Command and control infrastructure is hosted on subdomains of Azure and Appspot services to blend in with legitimate traffic. The threat actor also registers their own domains for command and control, often with a \"sync\"or \"update\"related theme. WinRAR is commonly used for compressing data prior to exfiltration.  Filenames for these archives often involve a string of numbers and variations of the word \"update\".  Data is exfiltrated using WATERCYCLE to cloud based platforms such as OneDrive and GoogleDrive.",

The attackers, which Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) tracks as BLACKATOM, posed as employees of legitimate companies\nand reached out via LinkedIn to invite targets to apply for software development freelance opportunities.

       "description":"(Trend Micro) Blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in Taiwan for many years. Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.\n\nLike most campaigns, Blackgear has evolved over time. Our research indicates that it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first, the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.",

The oldest sample we\u2019ve seen up to now is from November 2013.\n\nThis is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing.",

We speculate that other attacks delivering Bookworm were also targeting organizations in Thailand based on the contents of the associated decoys documents, as well as several of the dynamic DNS domain names used to host C2 servers that contain the words \u201cThai\u201d or \u201cThailand\u201d. Analysis of compromised systems seen communicating with Bookworm C2 servers also confirms our speculation on targeting with a majority of systems existing within Thailand.",

       "description":"(SecureWorks) In late 2015, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers began tracking financially motivated campaigns leveraging SamSam ransomware (also known as Samas and SamsamCrypt). CTU researchers associate this activity with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim\u2019s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim\u2019s files. The consistent tools and behaviors associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics. Organizations should also create and test response plans for ransomware incidents and use backup solutions that are resilient to corruption or encryption attempts.",

       "description":"(Group-IB) Buhtrap has been active since 2014, however their first attacks against financial institutions were only detected in August 2015. Earlier, the group had only focused on targeting banking clients. At the moment, the group is known to target Russian and Ukrainian banks.\n\nFrom August 2015 to February 2016 Buhtrap managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 mln). The number of successful attacks against Ukrainian banks has not been identified.\n\nBuhtrap is the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increases the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks have to shut down the whole infrastructure which provokes delay in servicing customers and additional losses.\n\nMalicious programs intentionally scan for machines with an automated Bank-Customer system of the Central Bank of Russia (further referred to as BCS CBR). We have not identified incidents of attacks involving online money transfer systems, ATM machines or payment gates which are known to be of interest for other criminal groups.\n\nBuhtrap has some infrastructure overlap with TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen.",

       "description":"(Wikipedia) The Central Intelligence Agency is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n\n(Yahoo) In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing Obama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive \u2014 known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 \u2014 the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.\n\nFormer officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.\n\nThis more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA\u2019s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as \u201cVault 7\u201d (see [Vault 7/8].) The leak, which a partially declassified CIA assessment called \u201cthe largest data loss in CIA history,\u201d was made possible by \u201cwoefully lax\u201d security practices at the CIA\u2019s top hacker unit, the assessment said.\n\nThe CIA was also one of the parties involved in Operation Olympic Games where Stuxnet was deployed in Iran.\n\nWhile not strictly related to APT activity and not just involving the CIA, the following publication in 3 parts sheds more light:\n1. <https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/>\n2. <https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/22/china-us-data-intelligence-cybersecurity-xi-jinping/>\n3. <https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/23/china-tech-giants-process-stolen-data-spy-agencies/>\n\nThe CIA has 2 subgroups:\n1. Subgroup: Longhorn, The Lamberts.\n2. Subgroup: [Unnamed group USA].",

Command-and-control (C&C) registrant information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable compilation times suggest early 2012. Their attacks continue to the present day. Symantec estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi infections within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was compromised with Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle and Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets. However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed.\n\nIf Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a single entity. Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state.",

       "description":"(Microsoft) Microsoft assesses that Cadet Blizzard operations are associated with the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) but are separate from other known and more established GRU-affiliated groups such as Forest Blizzard (Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit) and Seashell Blizzard (Sandworm Team, Iron Viking, Voodoo Bear). While Microsoft constantly tracks a number of activity groups with varying degrees of Russian government affiliation, the emergence of a novel GRU affiliated actor, particularly one which has conducted destructive cyber operations likely supporting broader military objectives in Ukraine, is a notable development in the Russian cyber threat landscape. A month before Russia invaded Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard foreshadowed future destructive activity when it created and deployed WhisperGate, a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs), against Ukrainian government organizations. Cadet Blizzard is also linked to the defacements of several Ukrainian organization websites, as well as multiple operations, including the hack-and-leak forum known as \u201cFree Civilian\u201d.\n\nMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022. We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present. Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas. Cadet Blizzard\u2019s operations, though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard, are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations. Primary targeted sectors include government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine, although organizations in Europe and Latin America have also been targeted.",

       "description":"(F-Secure) The most obvious common theme between all known targets of the Callisto Group is an involvement in European foreign and security policy, whether as a military or government official, being employed by a think tank, or working as a journalist. More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.\n\nThis targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive.\n\nIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances. While we don\u2019t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.\n\nWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group\u2019s activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.\n\nIt is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently available information.",

The hackers use a custom malware featuring some interesting anti-detection and anti-emulation techniques. The infrastructure used also shows some overlaps with Roaming Tiger and previous PlugX campaigns, but this could just be due to infrastructure reuse under the Chinese-speaking umbrella.",

The attackers employed two methods. They acquired domains that imitate legitimate ones. In addition, the APT group placed SSL certificates that also imitated legitimate ones on its servers. To achieve their goal, the attackers used a trending penetration method\u2014supply chain. The group compromised a subsidiary and penetrated the target company's network through it.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) In May 2024, we discovered a new advanced persistent threat (APT) targeting Russian government entities that we dubbed CloudSorcerer. It\u2019s a sophisticated cyberespionage tool used for stealth monitoring, data collection, and exfiltration via Microsoft Graph, Yandex Cloud, and Dropbox cloud infrastructure. The malware leverages cloud resources as its command and control (C2) servers, accessing them through APIs using authentication tokens. Additionally, CloudSorcerer uses GitHub as its initial C2 server.\n\nCloudSorcerer\u2019s modus operandi is reminiscent of the CloudWizard APT (Bad Magic, RedStinger) that we reported on in 2023. However, the malware code is completely different. We presume that CloudSorcerer is a new actor that has adopted a similar method of interacting with public cloud services.",

The group has conducted intrusions to steal money via targeting ATM systems, card processing, payment systems and SWIFT systems. Cobalt Group has mainly targeted banks in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. One of the alleged leaders was arrested in Spain in early 2018, but the group still appears to be active. The group has been known to target organizations in order to use their access to then compromise additional victims. Reporting indicates there may be links between Cobalt Group and both the malware Carbanak and the group Carbanak.",

       "description":"(Group-IB) In February 2015 the first major successful attack on a Russian trading system took place, when hackers gained unsanctioned access to trading system terminals using a Trojan resulting in trades of more than $400million.\n\nThe criminals made purchases and sales of US dollars in the Dollar/Ruble exchange program on behalf of a bank using malware. The attack itself lasted only 14 minutes, however, it managed to cause a high volatility in the exchange rate of between 55/62 (Buy/Sell) rubles per 1 dollar instead of the 60-62 stable range.\n\nTo conduct the attack criminals used the Corkow malware, also known as Metel, containing specific modules designed to conduct thefts from trading systems, such as QUIK operated by ARQA Technologies and TRANSAQ from ZAO \u201cScreen market systems\u201d. Corkow provided remote access to the ITS-Broker system terminal by \u00abPlatforma soft\u00bb Ltd., which enabled the fraud to be committed.\n\nIn August 2015 a new incident related to the Corkow (Metel) Trojan was detected. An attack on a bank card systems, which included about 250 banks which used the bank card system to service cash withdrawals from Visa and MasterCard cards under a special tariff. This attack resulted in the hundreds of millions of rubles being stolen via ATMs of the systems members.",

       "description":"(Talos) Cisco Talos is disclosing a new malware campaign called \u201cOperation Celestial Force\u201d running since at least 2018. It is still active today, employing the use of GravityRAT, an Android-based malware, along with a Windows-based malware loader we track as \u201cHeavyLift.\u201d\n\nAll GravityRAT and HeavyLift infections are administered by a standalone tool we are calling \u201cGravityAdmin,\u201d which carries out malicious activities on an infected device. Analysis of the panel binaries reveals that they are meant to administer and run multiple campaigns at the same time, all of which are codenamed and have their own admin panels.\n\nTalos attributes this operation with high confidence to a Pakistani nexus of threat actors we\u2019re calling \u201cCosmic Leopard,\u201d focused on espionage and surveillance of their targets.  This multiyear operation continuously targeted Indian entities and individuals likely belonging to defense, government and related technology spaces. Talos initially disclosed the use of the Windows-based GravityRAT malware by suspected Pakistani threat actors in 2018 \u2014 also used to target Indian entities.\n\nThe tactics, techniques, tooling and victimology of Cosmic Leopard contain some overlaps with those of Transparent Tribe, APT 36, another suspected Pakistani APT group, which has a history of targeting high-value individuals from the Indian subcontinent. However, we do not have enough technical evidence to link both the threat actors together for now, therefore we track this cluster of activity under the \u201cCosmic Leopard\u201d tag.",

The campaign, dubbed CostaRicto by BlackBerry, appears to be operated by \u201chackers-for-hire\u201d, a group of APT mercenaries who possess bespoke malware tooling and complex VPN proxy and SSH tunnelling capabilities.\nMercenary groups offering APT-style attacks are becoming more and more popular. Their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often resemble highly sophisticated state-sponsored campaigns, but the profiles and geography of their victims are far too diverse to be aligned with a single bad actor\u2019s interests.\nAlthough in theory the customers of a mercenary APT might include anyone who can afford it, the more sophisticated actors will naturally choose to work with patrons of the highest profile \u2013 be it large organizations, influential individuals, or even governments. Having a lot at stake, the cybercriminals must choose very carefully when selecting their commissions to avoid the risk of being exposed.",

This article presents temporal and technical analysis of these activities, based on open source intelligence (OSINT) from the Web. Appropriating the Ukrainian special police force name and logo, the group has aligned itself as pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian, and most recently attacked Western intervention efforts in the Ukrainian conflict. While the group has taken Ukrainian identities, technical links and contextual analysis connect the group to Russia.\n\nThe group began with successful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on multiple NATO websites just as separatists in the physical world were beginning to storm military buildings. Since their initial attacks the group has continued to take down websites, and most recently leaked confidential documents between US billionaire George Soros and the Ukrainian prime minister and president which contained plans for Western intervention.",

Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that DEV-0270 conducts malicious network operations, including widespread vulnerability scanning, on behalf of the government of Iran. However, judging from their geographic and sectoral targeting, which often lacked a strategic value for the regime, we assess with low confidence that some of DEV-0270\u2019s ransomware attacks are a form of moonlighting for personal or company-specific revenue generation.",

It is currently difficult to check whether this groupware product has a vulnerability or not, but if a server that is this exposed has a vulnerability, then there is a chance that companies could be affected gravely through the leakage of confidential information and ransomware behavior.

The threat actors behind this campaign use spear-phishing as a means of initial infection, sending emails with malicious attachments to the employees of financial institutions in at least five different French-speaking countries: Ivory Coast, Morocco, Cameroon, Senegal, and Togo.\nDangerousSavanna tends to install relatively unsophisticated software tools in the infected environments. These tools are both self-written and based on open-source projects such as Metasploit, PoshC2, DWservice, and AsyncRAT. The threat actors\u2019 creativity is on display in the initial infection stage, as they persistently pursue the employees of the targeted companies, constantly changing infection chains that utilize a wide range of malicious file types, from self-written executable loaders and malicious documents, to ISO, LNK, JAR and VBE files in various combinations. The evolving infection chains by the threat actor reflect the changes in the threat landscape seen over the past few years as infection vectors became more and more sophisticated and diverse.",

To date, Group-IB\u2019s Threat Intelligence has been able to attribute seven successful attacks to this particular group from June-December 2022, with targets including military bodies, government ministries and agencies, and religious and non-profit organizations, although the list of victims could be significantly longer.

The malware contains all the necessary modules for collecting all kinds of information about the user and the infected system and appears to be fully developed from scratch. Due to unique code overlaps, we assume with medium confidence that DarkUniverse\u2019s creators were connected with the ItaDuke set of activities. The attackers were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full lifecycle of their operations, so the observed samples from 2017 are totally different from the initial samples from 2009. The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the \u2018Lost in Translation\u2019 leak, or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations.",

This new variant was behind a series of ransomware campaigns beginning in June 2019, including attacks against the City of Edcouch, Texas and the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nWe have dubbed this new ransomware DoppelPaymer because it shares most of its code with the BitPaymer ransomware operated by Indrik Spider. However, there are a number of differences between DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer, which may signify that one or more members of Indrik Spider have split from the group and forked the source code of both Dridex and BitPaymer to start their own Big Game Hunting ransomware operation.\n\nDoppelPaymer has been observed to be distributed by Smoke Loader (operated by Smoky Spider) and Emotet (operated by Mummy Spider, TA542).",

The attacks are characterized by the use of the little known open source SparkRAT and malware that attempts to evade detection through Golang source code interpretation.\n\nThe DragonSpark attacks represent the first concrete malicious activity where we observe the consistent use of the open source SparkRAT, a relatively new occurrence on the threat landscape. SparkRAT is multi-platform, feature-rich, and frequently updated with new features, making the RAT attractive to threat actors.\n\nThe Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence team reported in late December 2022 on indications of threat actors using SparkRAT. However, we have not observed concrete evidence linking DragonSpark to the activity documented in the report by Microsoft.\n\nWe observed that the threat actor behind the DragonSpark attacks uses Golang malware that interprets embedded Golang source code at runtime as a technique for hindering static analysis and evading detection by static analysis mechanisms. This uncommon technique provides threat actors with yet another means to evade detection mechanisms by obfuscating malware implementations.",

       "description":"(Cylance) Very little public information was available throughout 2010 on this threat, despite the group\u2019s primary backdoor gaining some level of prominence in targeted Asian attacks. This may be explained by the group\u2019s early reliance on Dynamic DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, as well as their use of public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. In these attacks, a link to the exploit was sent via a spear phishing email from a purported Chinese student seeking advice or asking the target a question following a presentation.\n\nAs to other documented cases, the attacker started interacting with the infected machine within minutes of compromise to begin manual network and host enumeration.\n\nIn October 2011, the group attempted to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis at the time and phish the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s death on October 20, 2011. It appears that in addition to some US defense targets, this campaign was also directed at a Uyghur mailing list. This time, the group used a specially crafted malicious Windows Help (.hlp) file, which exploited CVE-2010-1885.",

The threat actor exploits public-facing servers and sends spear phishing emails to deliver previously unseen backdoors.\n\nOur research allowed us to identify the campaign\u2019s multiple connections with a China-nexus threat actor we track as Earth Lusca. However, since the campaign employs independent infrastructure and unique backdoors, we believe it to be a separate intrusion set that we named Earth Krahang.",

The malware used in the incident was a simple but custom Cobalt Strike loader. After further investigation, however, we found incidents targeting multiple regions using a similar Cobalt Strike loader. While analyzing code similarities and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), we discovered that the actor behind this attack has been active since 2020. After clustering each intrusion, we concluded that the threat actor is a new subgroup of advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT41 that we call Earth Longzhi.",

With no clear connection to any previous attack group, we gave this new threat actor the name \u201cEarth Wendigo.\u201d\n\nAdditional investigation shows that the threat actor also sent spear-phishing emails embedded with malicious links to multiple individuals, including politicians and activists, who support movements in Tibet, the Uyghur region, or Hong Kong. However, this is a separate series of attacks from their operation in Taiwan, which this report covers.",

The group gained notoriety for a heist they conducted in February 2019 against the Maltese Bank of Valletta, which initially resulted in roughly \u20ac13 million in losses, though much of this was subsequently recovered or frozen. While a thorough post-mortem of the Bank of Valletta attack has yet to be made public, it is highly likely that the threat actors sent malicious spear phishing emails to employees at Bank of Valletta and other European financial institutions. In October 2018, HSBC Malta reported receiving phishing emails that bore hallmarks of the subsequent EmpireMonkey attack against Bank of Valletta.\n\nThis group seems to be directly related to Carbanak, Anunak and/or FIN7.",

       "description":"(Ars Technica) Kaspersky researchers have documented 500 infections by Equation Group in at least 42 countries, with Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali topping the list. Because of a self-destruct mechanism built into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands.\n\nA long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group\u2019s extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include:\n\u2022 The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm Belgacom.\n\u2022 The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer\u2019s registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches of a computer\u2019s Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using antivirus software.\n\u2022 Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition, infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised both iOS and OS X devices.\n\u2022 The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure.\n\u2022 USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which are so sensitive that they aren\u2019t connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps.\n\u2022 An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution.\n\nTaken together, the accomplishments led Kaspersky researchers to conclude that Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the world, with technical skill and resources that rival the groups that developed Stuxnet and the Flame espionage malware in Operation Olympic Games.\n\nOther publicly exposed major APT activities from the NSA involve the wholesale worldwide spying from programs such as PRISM and, together with GCHQ, INCENSER, where various international Internet trunks were tapped.\n\nChina's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has accused the U.S. of breaking into Huawei's servers, stealing critical data, and implanting backdoors since 2009, amid mounting geopolitical tensions between the two countries.",

In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download additional malware components from the C&C server.",

       "description":"FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013. FIN7 has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage, transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of FIN7 was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, FIN7 shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked to the Carbanak Group, but there appears to be several groups using Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.",

They utilized techniques such as RAM shorting, buffer overflow, and a signing bug to achieve code execution and develop the Homebrew Channel for the Wii. In 2010, they compromised an ECDSA key for the PS3, and later announced the retrieval of PS5 symmetric root keys, enabling the potential for custom firmware and homebrew software. Their exploits often involve kernel access and have raised concerns about the implications for piracy and litigation in the gaming community.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) During the last months of 2019, we observed an ongoing campaign conducted by Fishing Elephant. The group continues to use both Heroku and Dropbox in order to deliver its tool of choice, AresRAT. We discovered that the actor incorporated a new technique into its operations that is meant to hinder manual and automatic analysis \u2013 geo-fencing and hiding executables within certificate files. During our research, we also detected a change in victimology that may reflect the current interests of the threat actor: the group is targeting government and diplomatic entities in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine and China.",

       "description":"(Microsoft) Flax Typhoon has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan. Some victims have also been observed elsewhere in Southeast Asia, as well as in North America and Africa. Flax Typhoon focuses on persistence, lateral movement, and credential access. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments.\n\nFlax Typhoon is known to use the China Chopper web shell, Metasploit, Juicy Potato privilege escalation tool, Mimikatz, and SoftEther virtual private network (VPN) client. However, Flax Typhoon primarily relies on living-off-the-land techniques and hands-on-keyboard activity. Flax Typhoon achieves initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing servers and deploying web shells like China Chopper. Following initial access, Flax Typhoon uses command-line tools to first establish persistent access over the remote desktop protocol, then deploy a VPN connection to actor-controlled network infrastructure, and finally collect credentials from compromised systems. Flax Typhoon further uses this VPN access to scan for vulnerabilities on targeted systems and organizations from the compromised systems.",

Following an apparent six-month gap in activity, during which time no victim names were posted, GOLD MYSTIC relaunched its RaaS scheme with LockBit 2.0 in mid-July, with the first victim revealed on July 13. Since then, GOLD MYSTIC and its affiliates have come to represent one of the most serious ransomware threats, having posted an additional 234 victims by the end of September 2021.\n\nCTU researchers have observed a variety of tools used to facilitate the deployment of LockBit 2.0 ransomware. These include exploiting vulnerabilities in Fortigate firewalls to gain entry to a network, using Mimikatz to harvest credentials and Netscan for reconnaissance, Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation activity and RDP to move between hosts.\n\nGOLD MYSTIC has also built its own bespoke data exfiltration tool \u2013 a remote access trojan (RAT) called StealBit \u2013 that they encourage affiliates to use.",

       "description":"GOLD RIVERVIEW was a financially motivated cybercriminal group that facilitated the distribution of malware- and scam-laden spam email on behalf of its customers. This threat group authored and sold the Necurs rootkit beginning in early 2014, including to GOLD EVERGREEN who integrated it into Gameover Zeus. GOLD RIVERVIEW also operated a global botnet that was colloquially known as Necurs (CraP2P) and was a major source of spam email from 2016 through 2018. Necurs distributed malware such as GOLD DRAKE's Dridex (Bugat v5), GOLD BLACKBURN's TrickBot, and other families like Locky and FlawedAmmy. Necurs also distributed a large volume of email pushing securities 'pump and dump' scams, rogue pharmacies, and fraudulent dating sites. On March 4, 2019 all three active segments of the Necurs botnet ceased operation and have not since resumed. On March 10, 2020 Microsoft took civil action against GOLD RIVERVIEW and made technical steps that would complicate the threat actors' ability to reconstitute the botnet.",

       "description":"GOLD SONATA is a financially motivated cybercriminal threat group that authored and distributed the Babuk Locker (also known as Babyk) ransomware on behalf of various affiliated threat groups. As of January 2021, when Babuk Locker first appeared on the scene, it was run by the threat actor \u201cbiba99\u201d as a private ransomware without affiliates. At the time, GOLD SONATA took the unusual approach of listing their ransomware victims on an English-language forum. In February 2021, GOLD SONATA began advertising for affiliates on Russian-speaking forums. GOLD SONATA earned notoriety with the April 2021 attack on The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC. That same month, GOLD SONATA announced they were closing the Babuk Locker project and making the source code publicly available. The group subsequently announced that they were moving away from ransomware deployment and were instead going to exclusively steal data and hold it hostage for ransom. These announcements are likely related to the blowback from the DC police attack.\n\nThe new GOLD SONATA operation was launched as \"Payload Bin\"in May 2021, with an associated leak site named Payload.bin, not to be confused with the GOLD DRAKE ransomware that emerged soon after and used the same name, probably in a deliberate attempt by GOLD DRAKE to evade U.S. Treasury sanctions. In June 2021, the compiled code for the Babuk Locker was released by \"biba99\"and in September 2021, the full source code was released by the threat actor \"dyadka0220\". Since the code was released, at least one variant has been introduced, called Delta Plus 2.3. In October 2021, Avast released a decryptor for Babuk Locker.\n\nGOLD SONATA expressed its ideology on public forums, indicating that it will not target non-profit organizations unless they are supporting \"LGBT\"or \"BLM\", referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and the Black Lives Matter movement. The attack against the DC police and subsequent increased scrutiny by government and media led to internal dissension within GOLD SONATA, causing the group to splinter into two groups, with \"Admin\"forming the RAMP cybercrime forum and the others launching version two of Babuk Locker. As of October 2021, it appears that the threat actors behind GOLD SONATA are now associated with Groove ransomware, including \"Orange\"(formerly known as \"TetyaSluha\") from RAMP and \"boriselcin\". There are indications that Groove is not an actual ransomware family, and that it was created as a joke by the threat actors intended to mislead the press. There is also a suggested connection between BlackMatter ransomware, operated by GOLD WATERFALL, and GOLD SONATA, due to the reported sharing of the same file server to store leaked files.",

Design information can also be used by cyberattackers to identify vulnerabilities in industrial control systems.",

The group stands out because it uses a formerly unknown Windows kernel-mode rootkit. Rootkits provide remote control access over the servers they target. Acting covertly, rootkits are notorious for hiding from investigators and security solutions. To bypass the Windows Driver Signature Enforcement mechanism, GhostEmperor uses a loading scheme involving a component of an open-source project named \u201cCheat Engine.\u201d This advanced toolset is unique and Kaspersky researchers see no similarity to already known threat actors. Kaspersky experts have surmised that the toolset has been in use since at least July 2020.",

       "description":"(Information Warfare Monitor) Cyber espionage is an issue whose time has come. In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan institutions.  The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information.\n\n(UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama\u2019s Private Office\nThe OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a courtesy telephone call, the diplomat\u2019s office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting. The Tibetans wondered whether a computer compromise might be the explanation; they called ONI Asia who called us. (Until May 2008, the first author was employed on a studentship funded by the OpenNet Initiative and the second author was a principal investigator for ONI.)\n\nAlso see Shadow Network.",

Some companies gave into extortion demands and paid fees so breaches would remain private.\n\"I came to an agreement with some companies, but the concerned startups won't see their data for sale,\"he said. \"I did it that's why I can't publish the rest of my databases or even name them.\"",

There is a decoy Word document inside the archive regarding terrorist attacks to lure the victim into decompressing. When the archive gets decompressed on the vulnerable computer, the embedded njRAT backdoor (Telegram Desktop.exe) will be extracted to the startup folder and then triggered into execution if the victim restarts the computer or performs re-login. After that, the attacker is capable to control the compromised device.",

This activity began in February 2023 and continued until at least May 2023.\n\nThe Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, has attributed this activity to a new group we are calling Grayling.

The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments \u2013 an allegation it has consistently denied.\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data \u2013 including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code \u2013 leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future.\nFollowing the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company\u2019s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team\u2019s resumed operations came six months later \u2013 a new sample of Hacking Team\u2019s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team\u2019s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team\u2019s shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news suggests it has ties to Saudi Arabia.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) In March 2018 we published our research on Olympic Destroyer, an advanced attack that hit organizers, suppliers and partners of the Winter Olympic Games 2018 held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and self-modifying destructive malware.\n\nWe are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack \u2013 \u201cHades\u201d. We have previously emphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that, the attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima APT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader, we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.\n\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer attack bear a certain resemblance to Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However, it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a master in the use of false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.",

Sectors targeted include telecommunications, government, and information technology (IT). The capabilities of the tools, their custom development, and the victims targeted, all suggest that Harvester is a nation-state-backed actor.",

The group, identifying as 'HomeLand Justice,' was attributed as an Iranian state threat actor.\n\nHomeland Justice launched its first campaign on July 15th, 2022, targeting Albanian e-government systems right before a planned conference of Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e Khalq (Persian:\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0647\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0650 \u062e\u0644\u0642), also known as MEK - a well-known Iranian group seeking to replace the current regime in Iran. The conference was cancelled following the attack. In September 2022, the actor launched a second campaign targeting Albanian border crossings. On December 24th, 2023, the actor publicized the current campaign, described in this blog, targeting Albanian infrastructure and government organizations.\n\n(Check Point) Void Manticore, linked to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), executes destructive wiping attacks alongside influence operations.\nOperating under various online personas, notably Homeland Justice for Albania and Karma for Israel, Void Manticore targets different regions with tailored attacks.\nOverlaps exist between Void Manticore and Scarred Manticore (OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene) targets, suggesting coordinated efforts and a systematic handoff of victims in MOIS.\nUtilizing five distinct methods, including custom wipers for Windows and Linux, Void Manticore disrupts operations through file deletion and shared drive manipulation.",

In line5with other research on the campaign, released prior to publication of this document, we have adopted the name \u201cInfy\u201d, which is based on labels used in the infrastructure and its two families of malware agents.\n\nThanks to information we have been able to collect during the course of our research, such as characteristics of the group\u2019s malware and development cycle, our research strongly supports the claim that the Infy group is of Iranian origin and potentially connected to the Iranian state. Amongst a backdrop of other incidents, Infy became one of the most frequently observed agents for attempted malware attacks against Iranian civil society beginning in late 2014, growing in use up to the February 2016 parliamentary election in Iran. After the conclusion of the parliamentary election, the rate of attempted intrusions and new compromises through the Infy agent slowed, but did not end. The trends witnessed in reports from recipients are reinforced through telemetry provided by design failures in more recent versions of the Infy malware.",

It is very focused on tracking the geopolitical agenda of targets in central Asia with a special focus in Mongolia, which seems to be an unusual target. This actor crafts campaigns for upcoming events of interest. In this case, they prepared and launched one right before a meeting with the International Monetary Fund and the Mongolian government at the end of January 2018. At the same time, they stopped their previous operations targeting Russian military contractors, which speaks volumes about the group\u2019s limitations. In this new campaign, they exploited CVE-2017-11882 to spread common RATs typically used by Chinese-speaking groups, such as PlugX and PoisonIvy.",

The threat actor leverages tailor-made malicious documents with embedded macros that trigger an infection chain, opening a URL in Internet Explorer. The minimal functionality present in the macros and the browser specification suggest that the threat actor might be exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability in Internet Explorer. Despite the small amount of evidence available for analysis in the Karkadann case, we were able to find several similarities to the Piwiks case, a watering-hole attack we discovered that targeted multiple prominent websites in the Middle East.",

       "description":"Kimsuky is a North Korea-based cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group initially focused on targeting South Korean government entities, think tanks, and individuals identified as experts in various fields, and expanded its operations to include the United States, Russia, Europe, and the UN. Kimsuky has focused its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.Kimsuky was assessed to be responsible for the 2014 Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. compromise; other notable campaigns include Operation STOLEN PENCIL (2018), Operation Kabar Cobra (2019), and Operation Smoke Screen (2019).North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups.",

Malware used by Lazarus Group correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups, such as Andariel, APT37, APT38, and Kimsuky.",

They appear not to have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don\u2019t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective.",

Named Lifting Zmiy, the group's first attacks were traced back to October 2023. The group targeted PLCs from Russian company Tech-Automatics usually used with elevators and which were still using their default passwords. Rostelecom has linked the group to intrusions at a Russian government contractor, two telecom operators, and an IT company. The company says the group collected and exfiltrated data and then destroyed the victim's infrastructure. Rostelecom says Lifting Zmiy uses Starlink infrastructure for attacks and appears to operate out of Eastern Europe.",

Active since at least 2016, LightBasin employs significant operational security (OPSEC) measures, primarily establishing implants across Linux and Solaris servers, with a particular focus on specific telecommunications systems,1 and only interacting with Windows systems as needed. LightBasin\u2019s focus on Linux and Solaris systems is likely due to the combination of critical telecommunications infrastructure running on those operating systems, in addition to the comparatively lax security measures and monitoring solutions on Linux/Solaris systems that are typically in place on Windows operating systems within an organization.\n\nLightBasin managed to initially compromise one of the telecommunication companies in a recent CrowdStrike Services investigation by leveraging external DNS (eDNS) servers \u2014 which are part of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network and play a role in roaming between different mobile operators \u2014 to connect directly to and from other compromised telecommunication companies\u2019 GPRS networks via SSH and through previously established implants. CrowdStrike identified evidence of at least 13 telecommunication companies across the world compromised by LightBasin dating back to at least 2019.\n\nThere is some overlap with UNC2891.",

It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.\n\nLonghorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally.\n\nLonghorn\u2019s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals\u2014all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.\n\nFor C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.",

The emails contain a malicious Microsoft Word attachment that uses macros to install and run malware that Proofpoint researchers have dubbed \u201cLookBack.\u201d This malware consists of a remote access Trojan (RAT) module and a proxy mechanism used for command and control (C&C) communication.\u202f We believe this may be the work of a state-sponsored APT actor based on overlaps with historical campaigns and macros utilized. The utilization of this distinct delivery methodology coupled with unique LookBack malware highlights the continuing threats posed by sophisticated adversaries to utilities systems and critical infrastructure providers.\n\nProofpoint found similarities in malware delivery with Stone Panda, APT 10, menuPass, but those may have been false flags.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) When we first encountered Lurk, in 2011, it was a nameless Trojan. It all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was able to interact automatically with the financial institution\u2019s remote banking service (RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself.\n\nIn 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed in order to start stealing the cash. Russia\u2019s banking system, like those of many other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to exploit the security gap.\n\nSo we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way: it didn\u2019t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its name. To \u201clurk\u201d means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush.\n\nWe were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk. This time we got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular structure.\n\nLater discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of development. It was formed of just two components, a number that would grow considerably over the coming years.",

However, MUMMY SPIDER swiftly developed the malware\u2019s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture.\nMUMMY SPIDER does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, MUMMY SPIDER usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.\nAfter a 10 month hiatus, MUMMY SPIDER returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a \u2018loader\u2019 delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.\n MUMMY SPIDER advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operate",

The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and stealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic Kitten.\n\nMagic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten\u2019s activities mirror those of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran\u2019s regional rivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten\u2019s custom malware agent dates to 2007, well before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be active.",

During the investigation, the Nocturnus Team uncovered a previously undocumented and stealthy RAT (Remote Access Trojan) dubbed ShellClient which was employed as the primary espionage tool.\nThe Nocturnus Team found evidence that the ShellClient RAT has been under ongoing development since at least 2018, with several iterations that introduced new functionalities, while it evaded antivirus tools and managed to remain undetected and publicly unknown.\nAssessments as to the identity of the operators and authors of ShellClient resulted in the identification of a new Iranian threat actor dubbed MalKamak that has operated since at least 2018 and remained publicly unknown thus far. In addition, our research points out possible connections to other Iranian state-sponsored APT threat actors such as Chafer, APT 39 and Agrius APT. However, we assess that MalKamak has distinct features that separate it from the other Iranian groups.",

Given the wide usage of STAR in LATAM, financial institutions in LATAM could have particular exposure to a potential interest from the MoneyTaker group.\n\nAlthough the group has been successful at targeting a number of banks in different countries, to date, they have gone unreported. In addition to banks, the MoneyTaker group has attacked law firms and also financial software vendors. In total, Group-IB has confirmed 20 companies as MoneyTaker victims, with 16 attacks on US organizations, 3 attacks on Russian banks and 1 in the UK.",

When Microsoft first detected Moonstone Sleet activity, the actor demonstrated strong overlaps with Diamond Sleet (Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima), extensively reusing code from known Diamond Sleet malware like Comebacker and using well-established Diamond Sleet techniques to gain access to organizations, such as using social media to deliver trojanized software. However, Moonstone Sleet quickly shifted to its own bespoke infrastructure and attacks. Subsequently, Microsoft has observed Moonstone Sleet and Diamond Sleet conducting concurrent operations, with Diamond Sleet still utilizing much of its known, established tradecraft.\n\nMoonstone Sleet has an expansive set of operations supporting its financial and cyberespionage objectives. These range from deploying custom ransomware to creating a malicious game, setting up fake companies, and using IT workers.",

       "description":"(Epic Turla) It\u2019s hard to understand the scope of this operation without access to victimology (e.g.: endpoint visibility or command-and-control sinkholing). Additionally, some possible timestomping muddies the water between this operation possible originating in 2008-2009 or actually coming into full force in 2010-2013 (the latter dates being corroborated by VT firstseen submission times and second-stage drop timestamps). There\u2019s a level of variable developmental capability visible throughout the stages. Multiple components are abused commonly-available resources, while the orchestrator and two of the DLL drops actually display some developmental ingenuity (in the form of seemingly novel COM techniques). Far from the most advanced coding practices but definitely better than the sort of .NET garbage other \u2018Farsi-speaking\u2019 APTs have gotten away with in the past.\n\nSomehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA\u2019s radar pre-2013. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for the disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this cluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes overlapping with EQGRP implants. Submissions of Nazar subcomponents from Iran (as well as privately shared visibility into historical and ongoing victimology clustered entirely on Iranian machines) could support that theory. Perhaps this is an internal monitoring framework (a la Attor) but given the sparse availability of historical data, I wouldn\u2019t push that beyond a low-confidence assessment, at this time.",

       "description":"(McAfee) Starting in November 2009, coordinated covert and targeted cyberattacks have been conducted against global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies. These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations.\n\nAttackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system. To deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company\u2019s defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies\u2019 networked computers.\n\nNight Dragon may be related to APT 18, Dynamite Panda, Wekby.",

       "description":"(FireEye) FireEye has been tracking ongoing activity associated with a unique and relatively stealthy group we first identified in 2013 using the name \u201cAPT.NineBlog.\u201c The name NINEBLOG refers to a specific backdoor used by the threat group; some versions of the backdoor use the string \u2018nineblog\u2019 in their command and control (CnC) URI path.\n\nWe have observed this group targeting organizations primarily in South Asia and the Middle East. The threat group is notable because it employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a backdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The group can maintain a low profile probably because the VBScripts are small and stealthy in their execution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to detect because the VBScripts are encoded and the actors employ SSL network communications. We have observed intermittent activity from this group since we first identified it in 2013, and we saw a spike in activity during mid-2015.\n\nWe assess that one of the probable targets of the group\u2019s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian government, based on the specificity of some of the decoy documents.\n\nIn addition to the anti-analysis techniques, the group has used SSL communications since we first identified this activity in 2013. The use of encrypted SSL traffic makes it extremely difficult to develop network-based signatures to detect the malware\u2019s communications.",

From late April to early May, the attackers focused on human rights related NGOs. They then moved on to the motor industry in late May. From June until mid-July no activity was detected. At this point, the current attack campaign against the chemical industry began. This particular attack has lasted much longer than previous attacks, spanning two and a half months.\n\nA total of 29 companies in the chemical sector were confirmed to be targeted in this attack wave and another 19 in various other sectors, primarily the defense sector, were seen to be affected as well. These 48 companies are the minimum number of companies targeted and likely other companies were also targeted. In a recent two week period, 101 unique IP addresses contacted a command and control server with traffic consistent with an infected machine. These Ips represented 52 different unique Internet Service Providers or organizations in 20 countries.\n\nNitro may be related to APT 18, Dynamite Panda, Wekby.",

It is almost certain that the entities targeted shared an interest in Yemen, security, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction matters. It is highly likely that OilAlpha threat actors were involved in espionage activity, as handheld devices were targeted with remote access tools (RATs) like SpyNote and SpyMax. Our assessment of the victimology suggests that the majority of the targeted entities were Arabic-language speakers and operated Android devices.",

Yet OldGremlin, made up of Russian speakers, is actively attacking Russian companies: banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, software developers\u2026 According to Group-IB expert estimations, since the spring OldGremlin has conducted at least seven phishing campaigns.

According to big data correlation analysis, OnionDog's first activity can be traced back to October, 2013 and in the following two years it was only active between late July and early September. The self-set life cycle of a Trojan attack is 15 days on average and is distinctly organizational and objective-oriented.\n\nOnionDog malware is transmitted by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the popular office software Hangul in Korean-language countries, and it attacked network-isolated targets through a USB Worm. In addition, OnionDog also used darkweb ('Onion City') communications tools, with which it can visit the domain without the Onion browser, making its real identity hidden in the completely anonymous Tor network.",

High-profile breaches, such as that of the Hilton Hotel and other similar establishments, were accomplished using point-of-sale (PoS) malware, leading many to fear digital threats on brick-and-mortar retailers this Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the rest of the holiday season. Researchers also found a broad campaign that uses the modular ModPOS malware to steal payment card data from retailers in the US.\n\nHowever, from what we have seen, it is not only retailers in the US that are at risk of breaches. Our researchers recently found an early version of a potentially powerful, adaptable, and invisible botnet that seeks out PoS systems within networks. It has already extended its reach to small and medium sized business networks all over the world, including a healthcare organization in the US. We are calling this operation Black Atlas, in reference to BlackPOS, the malware primarily used in this operation.\n\nOperation Black Atlas has been around since September 2015, just in time to plant its seeds before the holiday season. Its targets include businesses in the healthcare, retail, and more industries which rely on card payment systems.",

Although our initial analysis didn\u2019t show any novel or advanced techniques, we did observe strong persistence during the campaign that triggered our curiosity.\n\nWe followed network traces and pivoted on the information left behind by this actor, such as open directories, document metadata, and binary peculiarities, which enabled us to find a custom-made piece of malware, that we named \u201cCapturaTela\u201d. Our discovery of this malware family shows the reason for the persistent focus on hotel reservations as a primary vector: stealing credit card information from customers.\n\nWe profiled this threat actor and that has resulted in uncovering not only their delivery mechanisms, but also their arsenal of remote access tools and info-stealing trojans, both acquired from underground forums as well as open source tools found in GitHub repositories.",

In the investigation that followed, we tracked at least three clusters of intrusion activity from March 2023 to December 2023. The hunt also uncovered previously unreported malware associated with the threat clusters, as well as a new, improved variant of the previously-reported EAGERBEE malware. In line with our standard internal nomenclature, Sophos tracks these clusters as Cluster Alpha (STAC1248), Cluster Bravo (STAC1807), and Cluster Charlie (STAC1305).",

Its previous campaigns used watering hole tactics as an infection vector, using websites that discussed topics related to North Korea. Our continuous monitoring of this threat campaign shows that the threat actor behind SLUB didn\u2019t stop their attacks even during the pandemic. In 2020, we found multiple instances of their attacks in March, May, and September, delivering a new variant of the malware \u2014 this time incorporating new techniques and capabilities.\nIn addition, we found two unknown malware variants delivered along with SLUB during the latest attack at the end of September. Besides the CVEs already mentioned in the previous SLUB blog, we also found new exploits for the vulnerabilities CVE-2016-0189, CVE-2019-1458, CVE-2020-0674, and CVE-2019-5782, chained with another Chrome bug that does not have an associated CVE.\nThe campaign is very diversified, deploying numerous samples to the victim machines and using multiple command-and-control (C&C) servers during this operation. In total, we found the campaign using five C&C servers, seven samples, and exploits for four N-day bugs. The scale of the attack and the samples\u2019 custom design suggest that there is a group behind this operation. We dubbed the campaign as Operation Earth Kitsune.",

Various artifacts indicate that the main target of this campaign is IEC \u2013 Israel Electric Company. These include domains, file names, Java package names, and Facebook activity. We dubbed this campaign \u201cOperation Electric Powder\u201c.\n\nIsrael Electric Company (also known as Israel Electric Corporation) \u201cis the largest supplier of electrical power in Israel. The IEC builds, maintains, and operates power generation stations, sub-stations, as well as transmission and distribution networks. The company is the sole integrated electric utility in the State of Israel. It installed generating capacity represents about 75% of the total electricity production capacity in the country.\u201d\n\nIt is notable that the operational level and the technological sophistication of the attackers are not high. Also, they are having hard time preparing decoy documents and websites in Hebrew and English. Therefore, in most cases a vigilant target should be able to notice the attack and avoid infection. We do not have indication that the attacks succeeded in infecting IEC related computers or stealing information.\n\nCurrently we do not know who is behind Operation Electric Powder or what its objectives are.\n\nAlso see WildCard.\n\nThis actor is reported as potentially linked to the threat actor known as Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang, but no strong evidence has been found.",

       "description":"(Volexity) In December 2021, through its Network Security Monitoring service, Volexity identified a series of targeted spear-phishing campaigns against one of its customers from a threat actor it tracks as TEMP_Heretic. Analysis of the emails from these spear phishing campaigns led to a discovery: the attacker was attempting to exploit a zero-day cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Zimbra email platform. Zimbra is an open source email platform often used by organizations as an alternative to Microsoft Exchange.\n\nThe campaigns came in multiple waves across two attack phases. The initial phase was aimed at reconnaissance and involved emails designed to simply track if a target received and opened the messages. The second phase came in several waves that contained email messages luring targets to click a malicious attacker-crafted link. For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker's link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser. The link itself, however, could be launched from an application to include a thick client, such as Thunderbird or Outlook. Successful exploitation results in the attacker being able to run arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's Zimbra session. Volexity observed the attacker attempting to load JavaScript to steal user mail data and attachments.",

While the malicious VBA code and the dropped payloads were something we had seen before, it was the specific way in which the Excel documents themselves were created that caught our attention.\n\nThe creators of the malicious Excel documents used a technique that allows them to create macro-laden Excel workbooks, without actually using Microsoft Office. As a side effect of this particular way of working, the detection rate for these documents is typically lower than for standard maldocs.",

The operations have primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe, occasionally leveraging other themes such as anti-U.S. and COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti-NATO agenda. We have dubbed this campaign \u201cGhostwriter.\u201d\n\nMany, though not all of the incidents we suspect to be part of the Ghostwriter campaign, appear to have leveraged website compromises or spoofed email accounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified news articles, quotes, correspondence and other documents designed to appear as coming from military officials and political figures in the target countries.",

These have been highly active in the Middle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted attacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails that include compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.\n\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers\u2019 motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims\u2019 banking accounts or through selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300 employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.",

While we haven\u2019t been able to link the campaign, which we named Operation Jacana, to any specific APT group, we believe with medium confidence that a China-aligned threat group is behind this incident.\n\nIn the attack, the operators used a previously undocumented C++ backdoor that can exfiltrate files, manipulate Windows registry keys, execute CMD commands, and more. We named the backdoor DinodasRAT based on the victim identifier it sends to its C&C: the string always begins with Din, which reminded us of the hobbit Dinodas from the Lord of the Rings.",

These reports mainly center around the crypter that hides the usage of commodity malicious remote access tools.\n\nWe decided this would be a good starting point to demonstrate how a researcher can pivot from the initial discovery of a RAT and eventually profile a threat actor. This post will show how we discovered previous campaigns targeting the aviation industry, which links back to an actor that's been active for approximately six years.\n\nWe believe the actor is based out of Nigeria with a high degree of confidence and doesn't seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its activities without developing its own malware. The actor also buys the crypters that allow the usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has used several different cryptors, mostly bought on online forums.\n\nWe also believe with a high degree of confidence that the actor has been active for at least five years. For the last two, they've been targeting the aviation industry, while conducting other campaigns at the same time. Pivoting from an initial discovery is not an exact science \u2014 in this process, a researcher must assert a certain level of confidence in these associations.",

A hired actor is consistent with our findings on the Command and Control servers related to this campaign, which included web-based control panels for multiple RATs, suggesting that several campaigns were being run at once. A hired actor may also explain the generic and uninspired nature of the phishing, which often took the form of an email purporting to contain an invoice or a legal document with an attachment containing a blurry image. An investigation by the Swiss federal police of some of the emails linked to Operation Manul concludes that they were sent from IP addresses in India, which also suggests a link to Appin.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.\n\nOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).\n\nWith deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.\n\nAn overlap has been found between Operation Parliament and Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang.",

Currently, we have hints from known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity. And we are working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long running Chinese-speaking APT group, previously reported on as Lotus Blossom, Spring Dragon, Thrip, known for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware. Considering that this LightSpy activity has been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from TrendMicro, we would like to further contribute missing information to the story without duplicating content. And, in our quest to secure technologies for a better future, we reported the malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) In June 2021, Kaspersky ICS CERT experts identified malware whose loader has some similarities to the Manuscrypt malware, which is part of the Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima APT group\u2019s arsenal. In 2020, the group used Manuscrypt in attacks on defense enterprises in different countries. These attacks are described in the report \u201cLazarus targets defense industry with ThreatNeedle\u201d.\n\nCuriously, the data exfiltration channel of the malware uses an implementation of the KCP protocol that has previously been seen in the wild only as part of the APT 41 group\u2019s toolset.\n\nWe dubbed the newly-identified malware PseudoManuscrypt.\n\nThe PseudoManuscrypt loader makes its way onto user systems via a MaaS platform that distributes malware in pirated software installer archives. One specific case of the PseudoManuscrypt downloader\u2019s distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet (whose main installer is also distributed via the pirated software installer distribution platform). This means that the malware distribution tactics used by the threat actor behind PseudoManuscrypt demonstrate no particular targeting.\n\nDuring the period from January 20 to November 10, 2021, Kaspersky products blocked PseudoManuscrypt on more than 35,000 computers in 195 countries of the world. Such a large number of attacked systems is not characteristic of the Lazarus group or APT attacks as a whole.\n\nTargets of PseudoManuscrypt attacks include a significant number of industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and research laboratories.",

We discovered the attacks around the end of July, while the media reported the attack in South Korea on August 6.\n\nThe threat actors compromised the update server of a remote support solutions provider to deliver a remote access tool called 9002 RAT to their targets of interest through the update process. They carried this out by first stealing the company\u2019s certificate then using it to sign the malware. They also configured the update server to only deliver malicious files if the client is located in the range of IP addresses of their target organizations.\n\n9002 RAT also installed additional malicious tools: an exploit tool for Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 WebDav (exploiting CVE-2017-7269) and an SQL database password dumper. These tools hint at how the attackers are also after data stored in their target\u2019s web server and database.",

McAfee has detected the malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic BackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may recognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel to the infected machine).\n\nMcAfee has gained access to one specific Command & Control server used by the intruders. We have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log collection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time but that is the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were standard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit is sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit when opened on an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute and initiate a backdoor communication channel to the Command & Control web server and interpret the instructions encoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code. This will be quickly followed by live intruders jumping on to the infected machine and proceeding to quickly escalate privileges and move laterally within the organization to establish new persistent footholds via additional compromised machines running implant malware, as well as targeting for quick exfiltration the key data they came for.",

This campaign, Operation Sharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage implant\u2014which we call Rising Sun\u2014for further exploitation. According to our analysis, the Rising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group\u2019s 2015 backdoor Trojan Duuzer in a new framework to infiltrate these key industries.\nOperation Sharpshooter\u2019s numerous technical links to the Lazarus Group seem too obvious to immediately draw the conclusion that they are responsible for the attacks, and instead indicate a potential for false flags. Our research focuses on how this actor operates, the global impact, and how to detect the attack. We shall leave attribution to the broader security community.",

The attackers modified two of the software installers available for download on this website and added a backdoor in order to compromise users of the legitimate application.\n\nESET researchers uncovered this new supply-chain attack in early December 2020 and notified the compromised organization and the VNCERT. We believe that the website has not been delivering compromised software installers as of the end of August 2020 and ESET telemetry data does not indicate the compromised installers being distributed anywhere else. The Vietnam Government Certification Authority confirmed that they were aware of the attack before our notification and that they notified the users who downloaded the trojanized software.",

The final payload deploys payment scraping mechanisms on compromised websites to extract sensitive financial data from users.\n\nThe campaign has been active for over a year, and targets diverse industries that host or create payment infrastructure, such as online businesses and Point of Sales (POS) providers.

These attacks are still ongoing at the time of writing and are focused on both government institutions and private companies. For the latter, the most targeted sectors are energy and metallurgical. The attackers rely on the use of remote access trojans, most likely to spy on their victims. They have a large network infrastructure for command and control: ESET observed at least 24 different IP addresses in use in the second half of 2020. These are probably compromised devices that act as proxies for their C&C servers. This, combined with the use of dynamic DNS services, means that their infrastructure never stays still. We have seen at least 70 domain names active in this timeframe and they register new ones on a regular basis.",

Based on the detection timestamps of that toolset, we assess that the attacker had a foothold in the network from as early as 2018;\n\u2022 A couple of other tools that have significant code overlaps with Moriya were found as well. These contain a user mode version of the malware and another driver-based utility used to defeat AV software.",

       "description":"(Kaspersky) In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we looked into the file, we quickly found out that the inner-workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information.\n\nDuring the course of our research, we noticed that we were not the only ones to have found the operation. Researchers from Bitdefender also released an analysis of one of the samples in a blogpost. Although something had already been published, we decided to do something different with the data we acquired. The following month, we released a private report on our Threat Intelligence Portal to alert our clients about this newly discovered operation and began writing YARA rules in order to catch more samples. We decided to call the operation \u201cViceLeaker\u201d, because of strings and variables in its code.",

After reviewing of the PoC we provided, Google confirmed there was a zero-day vulnerability and assigned it CVE-2019-13720.\n\nWe are calling these attacks Operation WizardOpium. So far, we have been unable to establish a definitive link with any known threat actors. There are certain very weak code similarities with Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima attacks, although these could very well be a false flag. The profile of the targeted website is more in line with earlier DarkHotel attacks that have recently deployed similar false flag attacks.",

       "description":"One actor that has emerged in this trend of human-operated attacks is an active, highly adaptive group that frequently drops Wadhrama as payload.\n PARINACOTA impacts three to four organizations every week and appears quite resourceful: during the 18 months that we have been monitoring it, we have observed the group change tactics to match its needs and use compromised machines for various purposes, including cryptocurrency mining, sending spam emails, or proxying for other attacks. The group\u2019s goals and payloads have shifted over time, influenced by the type of compromised infrastructure, but in recent months, they have mostly deployed the Wadhrama ransomware.\nThe group most often employs a smash-and-grab method, whereby they attempt to infiltrate a machine in a network and proceed with subsequent ransom in less than an hour. There are outlier campaigns in which they attempt reconnaissance and lateral movement, typically when they land on a machine and network that allows them to quickly and easily move throughout the environment.\nPARINACOTA\u2019s attacks typically brute forces their way into servers that have Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposed to the internet, with the goal of moving laterally inside a network or performing further brute-force activities against targets outside the network. This allows the group to expand compromised infrastructure under their control. Frequently, the group targets built-in local administrator accounts or a list of common account names. In other instances, the group targets Active Directory (AD) accounts that they compromised or have prior knowledge of, such as service accounts of known vendors.\nThe group adopted the RDP brute force technique that the older ransomware called Samas (also known as SamSam) infamously used. Other malware families like GandCrab, MegaCortext, LockerGoga, Hermes, and RobbinHood have also used this method in targeted ransomware attacks. PARINACOTA, however, has also been observed to adapt to any path of least resistance they can utilize. For instance, they sometimes discover unpatched systems and use disclosed vulnerabilities to gain initial access or elevate privileges.",

The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.\n\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group\u2019s activities back as far as 2008.\n\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador. Who is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor.",

His post provides a good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing certificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues alluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group employing multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs).\n\nThe PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to companies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and Russia.\n\nThe PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae (CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older RATs like ZxShell and Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal community since their initial public release.",

Watering hole was used to delivery sample in this attack. The malicious samples were mainly disguised as chat software and some common software in specific fields. This Trojan has many functions such as stealing messages, contacts, WhatsApp and Telegram data, and uploading files using FTP. After reversing and correlation, we found that there is a strong correlation between the Pat Bear Organization and the Golden Rat issue, so this attack activity belongs to another branch of the Syrian Electronic Army.",

While the group has not been definitively attributed, circumstantial evidence suggests the group may be a pro-Indian or Indian entity. Patchwork has been seen targeting industries related to diplomatic and government agencies. Much of the code used by this group was copied and pasted from online forums. Patchwork was also seen operating spearphishing campaigns targeting U.S. think tank groups in March and April of 2018.",

The miner in question is an open-source tool named XMRig that generates the Monero cryptocurrency. Malware is delivered via downloads through the popular Adfly advertisement platform. Users are often mislead into clicking on a malicious advertisement that results in the payload being delivered to the victim. Once installed, the malware leverages VBS scripts and redirection services, such as bitly, to ultimately download and execute XMRig. Over 15 million confirmed victims have been discovered to be infected in recent campaigns, with actual numbers likely to be between 30-45 million victims. The victims are found across the globe, with high concentrations in Thailand, Vietnam, Egypt, Indonesia, and Turkey.",

       "description":"(Citizen Lab)\n\u2022 Between November 2018 and May 2019, senior members of Tibetan groups received malicious links in individually tailored WhatsApp text exchanges with operators posing as NGO workers, journalists, and other fake personas. The links led to code designed to exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages. This campaign was carried out by what appears to be a single operator that we call POISON CARP.\n\u2022 We observed POISON CARP employing a total of eight Android browser exploits and one Android spyware kit, as well as one iOS exploit chain and iOS spyware. None of the exploits that we observed were zero days. POISON CARP overlaps with two recently reported campaigns against the Uyghur community. The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called \u201cEvil Eye\u201d reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.\n\u2022 POISON CARP appears to have used Android browser exploits from a variety of sources. In one case, POISON CARP used a working exploit publicly released by Exodus Intelligence for a Google Chrome bug that was fixed in source, but whose patch had not yet been distributed to Chrome users. In other cases, POISON CARP used lightly modified versions of Chrome exploit code published on the personal GitHub pages of a member of Qihoo 360\u2019s Vulcan Team, a member of Tencent\u2019s Xuanwu Lab, and by a Google Project Zero member on the Chrome Bug Tracker.\n\u2022 This campaign is the first documented case of one-click mobile exploits used to target Tibetan groups, and reflects an escalation in the sophistication of digital espionage threats targeting the community.",

       "description":"(ESET) On August 27, 2018, a so-called zero-day vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows was published on GitHub and publicized via a rather acerbic tweet.\n\nIt seems obvious that this was not part of a coordinated vulnerability disclosure and there was no patch at the time this tweet (since deleted) was published to fix the vulnerability.\n\nIt affects Microsoft Windows OSes from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and in particular the Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) function, and allows a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE). LPE allows an executable or process to escalate privileges. In that specific case, it allows an executable launched by a restricted user to gain administrative rights.\n\nThe tweet linked to a GitHub repository that contains Proof-of-Concept code for the exploit. Not only was a compiled version released \u2013 the source code was also. Consequently, anyone can modify and recompile the exploit, in order to \u201cimprove it\u201d, evade detection, or even incorporate it into their code.\n\nAs one could have predicted, it took only two days before we first identified the use of this exploit in a malicious campaign from a group we have dubbed PowerPool. This group has a small number of victims and according to both our telemetry and uploads to VirusTotal (we only considered manual uploads from the web interface), the targeted countries include Chile, Germany, India, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Ukraine.",

Morphisec identified the campaign after receiving notifications from its advanced prevention solution at several deployment sites. (Morphisec\u2019s Moving Target Defense technology immediately stopped the threat.) The attack uses multiple advanced evasive techniques to bypass security tools. In a successful attack, the Orcus RAT can steal browser cookies and passwords, launch server stress tests (DDoS attacks), disable the webcam activity light, record microphone input, spoof file extensions, log keystrokes and more.\n\nThe forensic data captured by Morphisec from the attack showed a high correlation to additional samples in the wild, indicating a single threat actor is behind multiple campaigns, including this one.\n\nThis threat actor specifically focuses on information stealing and .NET evasion. Based on unique strings in the malware, we have dubbed the actor PUSIKURAC. Before executing the attacks, PUSIKURAC registers domains through FreeDns services. It also utilizes legitimate free text storage services like paste, signs its executables, heavily misuses commercial .NET packers and embeds payloads within video files and images.",

The campaigns targeted industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and the Republic of Korea. This leads us to believe that they are all the work of the same actors\u2014a group we\u2019ve dubbed RATicate.\n\nA new campaign we believe connected to the same actors leverages concern about the global COVID-19 pandemic to convince victims to open the payloads. This is a shift in tactics, but we suspect that this group constantly changes the way they deploy malware\u2014and that the group has conducted campaigns prior to this past November.",

       "description":"In 2021, PwC started tracking a series of intrusions under the moniker of Red Dev 17 that they assess were highly likely conducted by a China-based threat actor. Their analysis suggests Red Dev 17 has been active since at least 2017. Red Dev 17's observed targets are mainly in India, and include the Indian military, a multinational India-based technology company, and a state energy company. They assess that it is highly probable that the threat actor behind intrusions associated with Red Dev 17 is also responsible for the campaign known in open source as Operation NightScout. Red Dev 17 is a user of the 8.t document weaponisation framework (also known as RoyalRoad), and abuses benign utilities such as Logitech or Windows Defender binaries to sideload and execute Chinoxy or PoisonIvy variants on victim systems. They identified capability and infrastructure links between Red Dev 17 and the threat actor they call Red Hariasa (aka FunnyDream APT), as well as infrastructure overlaps with Red Wendigo (aka Icefog, RedFoxtrot), and with ShadowPad C2 servers. At this time, they do not have sufficient evidence to directly link Red Dev 17 to any of these threat actors. However, They assess with realistic probability that Red Dev 17 operates within a cluster of threat actors that share tools and infrastructure, as well as a strong targeting focus on Southeast Asia and Central Asia.",

The campaigns, which we are collectively naming RedAlpha, combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling. We discovered this activity as the result of pivoting off of a new malware sample observed targeting the Tibetan community based in India.\n\nInsikt Group\u2019s analysis of infrastructure overlap among the new campaigns reveals wider targeting of the Chinese \u201cFive Poisons,\u201d in addition to South and Southeast Asian governments. Based on the campaign\u2019s targeting of \u201cFive Poisons\u201d-related organizations, overlapping infrastructure, and links to malware used by other Chinese APTs uncovered during our research, we assess with medium confidence that the RedAlpha campaigns were conducted by a Chinese APT.\n\nInfrastructure overlaps have been found with APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda, Icefog, Dagger Panda and NetTraveler, APT 21, Hammer Panda.",

       "description":"(Recorded Future) Since early 2020, Recorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group observed a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organizations from Chinese state-sponsored groups. From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future\u2019s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India\u2019s power sector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India\u2019s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included 2 Indian seaports.\n\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including APT 41 and Tonto Team, HartBeat, Karma Panda.\n\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular campaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.\n\nAlso see TAG-38.",

       "description":"(Recorded Future) RedFoxtrot has been active since at least 2014 and predominantly targets government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan, aligning with the likely operational remit of Unit 69010. Of particular note, within the past 6 months, Insikt Group detected RedFoxtrot network intrusions targeting 3 Indian aerospace and defense contractors; major telecommunications providers in Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan; and multiple government agencies across the region. RedFoxtrot maintains large amounts of operational infrastructure and has likely employed both bespoke and publicly available malware families commonly used by Chinese cyber espionage groups, including Icefog, PlugX, Royal Road, Poison Ivy, ShadowPad, and PCShare. RedFoxtrot activity overlaps with threat groups tracked by other security vendors as Temp.Trident and Nomad Panda.",

       "description":"(Cornell University) The commoditization of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows criminals to obtain financial benefits at a low risk and with little technical background. One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.",

As part of their activities, this group hacks into exploitable routers and changes their DNS configuration. This allows the attackers to redirect the router user's traffic to malicious Android apps disguised as Facebook and Chrome or to Apple phishing pages that were used to steal Apple ID credentials.\nRecently, Kaspersky has discovered that this group is testing a new monetization scheme by redirecting iOS users to pages that contain the Coinhive in-browser mining script rather than the normal Apple phishing page. When users are redirected to these pages, they will be shown a blank page in the browser, but their CPU utilization will jump to 90% or higher.",

Because \u201cnoisier\u201d campaigns are becoming increasingly well-known within the security community, new and smaller campaigns are beginning to emerge.\n\nThis research paper documents the operations of a campaign we refer to as \u201cSafe,\u201d based on the names of the malicious files used. It is an emerging and active targeted threat.\n\nWhile we have yet to determine the campaign\u2019s total number of victims, it appears that nearly 12,000 unique IP addresses spread over more than 100 countries were connected to two sets of command-and-control (C&C) infrastructures related to Safe. We also discovered that the average number of actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day. This indicates that the actual number of victims is far less than the number of unique IP addresses. Due to large concentrations of IP addresses within specific network blocks, it is likely that the number of victims is even smaller and that they have dynamically assigned IP addresses, which have been compromised for some time now.",

On average, less than ten unique computers are infected per month and there is no indication that the attackers are trying to spread through the victim\u2019s local network, suggesting that Scarab\u2019s campaigns are extremely targeted in nature.",

       "description":"(Talos) Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling \u201cSea Turtle,\u201d which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems.\n\nThe actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization\u2019s domain names.",

From July 2020 into October 2020, RiskIQ systems uncovered 20 unique targets in Australia, Afghanistan, the UK, and the USA.\n\nAll these attacks used similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as Mabna Institute, Cobalt Dickens, Silent Librarian, an Iranian company that, according to the FBI, was created for illegally gaining access 'to non-Iranian scientific resources through computer intrusions.' Mabna Institute earned the moniker 'Silent Librarian' due to its focused efforts to compromise university students and faculty by impersonating university library resources using domain shadowing to harvest credentials.\n\nHowever, while RiskIQ's findings are consistent with TTPs in use by Silent Librarian, they alone are not sufficient to attribute the threat activity we've detected against these 20 universities directly to Mabna Institute. Therefore, RiskIQ has named actors identified during this research as 'Shadow Academy.'",

       "description":"(Information Warfare Monitor) Shadows in the Cloud documents a complex ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised government, business, academic, and other computer network systems in India, the Offices of the Dalai Lama, the United Nations, and several other countries. The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows\u2019 attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing systems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.\n\nAlso see GhostNet, Snooping Dragon.",

Related activities date back to more than a decade ago, with similar code maintaining compilation timestamps from 2004. Since then, ShaggyPanther activity has been detected in several more locations: most recently in Indonesia in July, and \u2013 somewhat surprisingly \u2013 in Syria in March. The newer 2018 and 2019 backdoor code maintains a new layer of obfuscation and no longer maintains clear-text C2 strings. Since our original release, we have identified an initial server-side infection vector from this actor, using SinoChopper/ChinaChopper, a commonly used web shell shared by multiple Chinese-speaking actors. SinoChopper not only performs host identification and backdoor delivery but also email archive theft and additional activity. Although not all incidents can be traced back to server-side exploitation, we did detect a couple of cases and obtained information about their staged install process. In 2019, we observed ShaggyPanther targeting Windows servers.",

Similar to the Safe Campaign, the campaigns we noted went seemingly unnoticed and under the radar.\n\n(FireEye) FireEye recently looked deeper into the activity discussed in TrendMicro\u2019s blog and dubbed the \u201cSiesta\u201d campaign. The tools, modus operandi, and infrastructure used in the campaign present two possibilities: either the Chinese cyber-espionage unit Comment Crew, APT 1 is perpetrating this activity, or another group is using the same tactics and tools as the legacy APT1.\n\nThe Siesta campaign reinforces the fact that analysts and network defenders should remain on the lookout for known, public indicators and for shared attributes that allow security experts to detect multiple actors with one signature.",

While referencing a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director\u2019s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English\u00adlanguage proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common right\u00adto\u00adleft filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension. All of these techniques, while common pretexting mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would eventually be successful.",

In turn, this infected the administrator of the router.\n\nWe believe this cluster of activity started in at least 2012 and was still active at the time of this analysis (February 2018).",

Although the payload itself remains similar to the one found in older PlugX variants, its delivery methods results in low detection rates, which until recently helped the campaign fly under the radar.",

The later registration style was eerily close to previously registered APT28 domains, however, the malware used in the attacks did not seem to line up at all. During the course of our investigation, JPCERT published this analysis of one of the group\u2019s backdoors. Cylance tracks this threat group internally as \u2018Snake Wine\u2019.\n\nThe Snake Wine group has proven to be highly adaptable and has continued to adopt new tactics in order to establish footholds inside victim environments. The exclusive interest in Japanese government, education, and commerce will likely continue into the future as the group is just starting to build and utilize their existing current attack infrastructure.",

Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel re-published the slide set with far less deletions recently, in January 2015, and therefore gave a deeper insight about what CSEC actually says they have tracked down.\n\nThe newly published documents reveal: the so called operation SNOWGLOBE, was discovered in 2009 (slide 9) and consists of three different \u201cimplants\u201d, two were dubbed snowballs and one \u201cmore sophisticated implant, discovered in mid-2010\u201d is tagged as snowman (slide 7). According to slide 22, \u201cCSEC assesses, with moderate certainty, SNOWGLOBE to be a state-sponsored CNO [Cyber Network Operation] effort, put forth by a French intelligence agency.\u201d The information given dates back to 2011 and nothing else has been published since. Now that specific Babar samples have been identified and analyzed, there might be new information, also with regards to similarities or differences between the two Remote Administration Tools (RATs) EvilBunny and Babar.",

The main victims are political and military organizations in Egypt, Israel and possibly other countries.  Sensitive data theft is what the attackers plotted for during the period from June, 2014 to November, 2015 when the activity was in its prime. We encountered some timestamps of the samples to be as early as December, 2011 which suggests the attack might be started much earlier, though further sound proof is needed. The main approach of Sphinx is watering hole attack on social web sites. Until now, we have obtained 314 pieces of sample malicious codes and 7 C2 domains.",

       "description":"(CrowdStrike) In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed both SPRITE SPIDER (the operators of Defray777) and Carbanak, Anunak (the operators of DarkSide) deploy Linux versions of their respective ransomware families on ESXi hosts during BGH operations. While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors have historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of hypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines (VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate legacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to increase the impact against a victim.\n\nAll identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four separate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to log in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely used the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter administrator credentials stored in a web browser.\n\nBy targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple systems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi server inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware on each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also improve the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional operating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent or detect ransomware attacks.",

Storm-0558 pursues this objective through credential harvesting, phishing campaigns, and OAuth token attacks. This threat actor has displayed an interest in OAuth applications, token theft, and token replay against Microsoft accounts since at least August 2021. Storm-0558 operates with a high degree of technical tradecraft and operational security. The actors are keenly aware of the target\u2019s environment, logging policies, authentication requirements, policies, and procedures. Storm-0558\u2019s tooling and reconnaissance activity suggests the actor is technically adept, well resourced, and has an in-depth understanding of many authentication techniques and applications.\n\nWhile we have discovered some minimal overlaps with other Chinese groups such as Violet Typhoon (APT 31, Judgment Panda, Zirconium), we maintain high confidence that Storm-0558 operates as its own distinct group.",

Based on our research, SWEED \u2014 which has been operating since at least 2017 \u2014 primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans.\n\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a myriad of different types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a packed version of Agent Tesla \u2014 an information stealer that\u2019s been around since at least 2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from what we\u2019ve seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the system. In this post, we\u2019ll run down each campaign we\u2019re able to connect to SWEED, and talk about some of the actor\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).",

In May 5, 2011 the Syrian Computer Society registered SEA\u2019s website (syrian-es.com). Because Syria's domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written that the group was supervised by the Syrian state. SEA claimed on its webpage to be no official entity, but 'a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria'. As soon as May 27, 2011 SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity. On the new page, the description of 'not an official entity' was removed, only says that it was established by a group of young Syrian enthusiasts to combat the use of the Internet, especially people that use of Facebook in Syria to 'spread hatred' and 'destroy peace'.\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army uses spam, website defacement, malware, phishing and denial of service attacks against political opposition groups, Western news agencies, human rights groups and seemingly neutral websites for Syrian conflicts. It also attacked government websites in the Middle East and Europe as well as US defense contractors. The Syrian Electronic Army is the first Arab organization to set up a public Internet army on its national network to openly launch cyber-attacks on its enemies.\n\nSyrian Electronic Army has 2 subgroups:\n1. Subgroup: Goldmouse, APT-C-27\n2. Subgroup: Pat Bear, APT-C-37",

We have also recently observed the actor targeting organizations in the United States using the IcedID banking Trojan while impersonating the United States Postal Service (USPS).",

The actor, known as TA2552, uses well-crafted Spanish language lures that leverage a narrow range of themes and brands. The lures entice users to click a link in the message, taking them to the legitimate Microsoft third-party apps consent page. There they are prompted to grant a third-party application read-only user permissions to their O365 account via OAuth2 or other token-based authorization methods. TA2552 seeks access to specific account resources like the user\u2019s contacts and mail. Requesting read-only permissions for such account resources could be used to conduct account reconnaissance, silently steal data, or to intercept password reset messages from other accounts such as those at financial institutions. While organizations with global presence have received messages from this group, they appear to choose recipients who are likely Spanish speakers.",

       "description":"(Proofpoint) Beginning in the first half of 2020, the rapid international spread of the COVID-19 virus introduced a shift within the threat landscape towards pandemic-themed social engineering lures. Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting COVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against established and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a phishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) guidance on COVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have dubbed \u201cSepulcher\u201d. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic affairs.  Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to historic Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads linked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020 targeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher malware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked to historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT malware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint researchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously been documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413\u2019s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020 before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.\n\nAn overlap in infrastructure has been observed with Lucky Cat.",

In this instance, we observed SmokeLoader downloading a Monero coinminer. Since the middle of 2017, TA516 has used similar macro-laden documents as well as malicious JavaScript hosted on Google Drive to distribute both Panda Banker and a coinminer executable via SmokeLoader, often in the same campaigns.",

For example, intended victims frequently have titles of Chief Financial Officer, Head of Finance, Senior Vice President, Director and other high level roles.\n\nAdditionally, TA530 customizes the email to each target by specifying the target\u2019s name, job title, phone number, and company name in the email body, subject, and attachment names. On several occasions, we verified that these details are correct for the intended victim. While we do not know for sure the source of these details, they frequently appear on public websites, such as LinkedIn or the company\u2019s own website. The customization doesn't end with the lure; the malware used in the campaigns is also targeted by region and vertical.",

The campaigns appear to primarily target hotels, restaurants, and telecommunications, and are distributed by an actor we track as TA555. To date, we have observed AdvisorsBot used as a first-stage payload, loading a fingerprinting module that, as with Marap, is presumably used to identify targets of interest to further infect with additional modules or payloads. AdvisorsBot is under active development and we have also observed another version of the malware completely rewritten in PowerShell and .NET.",

Using Recorded Future\u00ae Network Intelligence data, Insikt Group identified the likely compromise of the secretariats of two major Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations by TAG100 using the open-source, multi-platform Go backdoor Pantegana. Other targeted organizations include multiple diplomatic entities and ministries of foreign affairs, as well as industry trade associations and semiconductor supply-chain, non-profit, and religious organizations globally.

       "description":"(Recorded Future) In recent months, we observed likely network intrusions targeting at least 7 Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states. Notably, this targeting has been geographically concentrated, with the identified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the disputed India-China border in Ladakh. One of these SLDCs was also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest set of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting of power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity group. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and co-opted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control (C2) of Shadowpad malware infections, as well as use of the open source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP).\n\nDespite a partial troop disengagement between India and China from February 2021, the prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure continues to raise concerns over pre-positioning activity being conducted by Chinese adversaries. While this latest activity displays targeting and capability consistencies with previously identified RedEcho activity, there are also some notable distinctions. At this time, we have not identified technical evidence allowing us to attribute it to RedEcho, and we are currently clustering this latest activity under the temporary group name Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38).",

Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.\n\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background.\n\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers\u2019 activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.",

Known as the TeamSpy crew because of its affinity for using the legitimate TeamViewer application as part of its toolset, the attackers may have been active for as long as 10 years, researchers say.\n\nThe attack appears to be a years-long espionage campaign, but experts who have analyzed the victim profile, malware components and command-and-control infrastructure say that it\u2019s not entirely clear what kind of data the attackers are going after. What is clear, though, is that the attackers have been at this for a long time and that they have specific people in mind as targets.\n\nResearchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary were alerted by the Hungarian National Security Authority to an attack against a high-profile target in the country and began looking into the campaign. They quickly discovered that some of the infrastructure being used in the attack had been in use for some time and that the target they were investigating was by no means the only one.",

       "description":"(ZDNet) A hacking campaign used fake Facebook profiles to trick targets into downloading malware capable of stealing vast swathes of information, including messages, photos, audio recordings and even the exact location of victims.\n\nThe group has been operating since as early as 2015 and is thought to have infected the Android phones of hundreds selected targets across the Middle East. The the highest concentration of infections is in Israel, but victims have also been seen in the US, China, Germany and France.\n\nUncovered by researchers at Avast, the operation has been dubbed 'Tempting Cedar Spyware'. The name combines the main means of attack - by tricking victims using fake social media profiles purporting to be those of a young woman - with the Cedar tree, which features prominently on the flag of Lebanon.\n\nThe campaign for distributing the malware begins with fake Facebook profiles which are designed to lure in victims - predominantly men - with 'flirty' conversations.",

Destructive attacks like these have been observed repeatedly over the years and the Windows Defender and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Threat Intelligence teams are working on protection, detection, and response to these threats.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence identified similarities between this recent attack and previous 2012 attacks against tens of thousands of computers belonging to organizations in the energy sector. Microsoft Threat Intelligence refers to the activity group behind these attacks as Terbium, following our internal practice of assigning rogue actors chemical element names.",

We identified one specific spear phishing campaign launched against targets within Palestine, and specifically against Palestinian law enforcement agencies. This campaign started in April 2017, using a spear phishing campaign to deliver the MICROPSIA payload in order to remotely control infected systems. Although this technique is not new, it remains an effective technique for attackers.\n\nThe malware itself was developed in Delphi; in this article, we describe the features and the network communication to the command and control server used by the attackers. The threat actor has chosen to reference TV show characters and include German language words within the attack. Most significantly, the attacker has appeared to have used genuine documents stolen from Palestinian sources as well as a controversial music video as part of the attack.\n\n(Check Point) While the APT has gone through significant upgrades over the past year, the conductors of these campaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware development conventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to past attacks, and may also have some resemblance to attacks related to the Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang APT group.",

Upon execution, it will first brute force its own decryption key (a 32-bit value, meaning this takes a fraction of second on modern PCs) before using this to decrypt the main program code.\n\nThe core functionality of the decrypted code is communication with a set of hardcoded C2 servers by IP and port. If the C2 is active, it will provide what is effectively a piece of shellcode, encrypted by another 32-bit constant. This shellcode is not \u2018fire and forget\u2019: it instead sees the loader establish a semi-interactive two-way communication with the C2. Note that the earliest traits and mentions of TinyLoader go back to as far as 2015.",

Tomiris\u2019s endgame consistently appears to be the regular theft of internal documents.\n\nThe threat actor targets government and diplomatic entities in the CIS. The occasional victims discovered in other regions (such as the Middle East or South-East Asia) turn out to be foreign representations of CIS countries, illustrating Tomiris\u2019s narrow focus.\n\nIt is characterized by its tendency to develop numerous low-sophistication \u201cburner\u201d implants in a variety of programming languages that are repeatedly deployed against the same targets, using elementary but efficient packaging and distribution techniques. Tomiris occasionally leverages commercial or open-source RATs.\nLanguage artifacts discovered in Tomiris\u2019s implant families and infrastructure from distinct campaigns all indicate that the threat actor is Russian-speaking.\n\nOverall, Tomiris is a very agile and determined actor, open to experimentation \u2013 for instance with delivery methods (DNS hijacking) or command and control (C2) channels (Telegram).\n\nKaspersky also asserts that there exists a form of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and Turla, Waterbug, Venomous Bear.",

This is a new actor operating since July 2021. Prior to this ransomware, Tortilla has been experimenting with other payloads, such as the PowerShell-based netcat clone Powercat, which is known to provide attackers with unauthorized access to Windows machines.\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that the initial infection vector is exploitation of ProxyShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server through the deployment of China Chopper web shell.",

The operation may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity was observed in April 2022.\n\nThis activity was attributed to a Chinese threat actor, with possible connections to Stone Panda, APT 10, menuPass, a sophisticated and experienced nation-state-backed actor, and Mustang Panda, another proficient China-based cyber espionage group. The campaign has been dubbed Twisted Panda to reflect the sophistication of the tools observed and the attribution to China.\n\nThe hackers use new tools, which have not previously been described: a sophisticated multi-layered loader and a backdoor dubbed SPINNER. These tools use advanced evasion and anti-analysis techniques such as multi-layer in-memory loaders and compiler-level obfuscations.",

Mandiant has linked the use of SOMBRAT to the deployment of ransomware, which has not been previously reported publicly.\n\nUNC2447 monetizes intrusions by extorting their victims first with FIVEHANDS ransomware followed by aggressively applying pressure through threats of media attention and offering victim data for sale on hacker forums. UNC2447 has been observed targeting organizations in Europe and North America and has consistently displayed advanced capabilities to evade detection and minimize post-intrusion forensics.",

       "description":"(Mandiant) Following the discovery of malware residing within ESXi hypervisors in September 2022, Mandiant began investigating numerous intrusions conducted by UNC3886, a suspected China-nexus cyber espionage actor that has targeted prominent strategic organizations on a global scale. In January 2023, Mandiant provided detailed analysis of the exploitation of a now-patched vulnerability in FortiOS employed by a threat actor suspected to be UNC3886. In March 2023, we provided details surrounding a custom malware ecosystem utilized on affected Fortinet devices. Furthermore, the investigation uncovered the compromise of VMware technologies, which facilitated access to guest virtual machines.\n\nInvestigations into more recent operations in 2023 following fixes from the vendors involved in the investigation have corroborated Mandiant's initial observations that the actor operates in a sophisticated, cautious, and evasive nature. Mandiant has observed that UNC3886 employed several layers of organized persistence for redundancy to maintain access to compromised environments over time. Persistence mechanisms encompassed network devices, hypervisors, and virtual machines, ensuring alternative channels remain available even if the primary layer is detected and eliminated.",

UNC3890, the threat actor behind the attacks, deployed two proprietary pieces of malware \u2013 a backdoor named \u201cSUGARUSH\u201d and a browser credential stealer called \u201cSUGARDUMP\u201d, which exfiltrates password information to email addresses registered with Gmail, ProtonMail, Yahoo and Yandex email services. The threat actor also employs a network of C&C servers that host fake login pages impersonating legitimate platforms such as Office 365, LinkedIn and Facebook. These servers are designed to communicate with the targets and also with a watering hole hosted on the login page of a legitimate Israeli shipping company.",

Successful exploitation could result in authentication bypass and command injection, leading to further downstream compromise of a victim network.

Probing has been observed against the academic, energy, defense, and health sectors, which aligns with past Volt Typhoon interest in critical infrastructure. In Feb. 2024, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an advisory warning that Volt Typhoon was targeting critical infrastructure and was potentially interested in Ivanti Connect Secure devices for initial access.",

The default certificate for GOST proxy was observed from Sept. 1, 2022 through Jan. 1, 2024. UNC5330 also attempted to download Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) from this server on Feb. 3, 2024, from a compromised Ivanti Connect Secure device.

Even though new attacks were detected at the time, part of the group's infrastructure remained active and some sites were still infected. The cybercriminals did not use existing domains for new attacks but switched to a new infrastructure to store malicious code and collect intercepted payment data.",

Based on the victimology and the cyber-attack\u2019s aim, we believe the threat actor is aligned with China\u2019s interests.\nAs tensions in the region rise, they are reflected in the intensification of activity on behalf of the Unfading Sea Haze actor, which uses new and improved tools and TTPs.\nWe noticed multiple times that the actor was regaining access to the victim\u2019s systems either because of improper credential hygiene or because of bad patching strategies of the edge devices and exposed web services. Thus, this publication intends to raise awareness of the importance of respecting essential best practices that ensure security and to share with the community information that could help detect and disrupt Unfading Sea Haze\u2019s espionage activities.",

This leaking was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018.\nMost of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, by many have been used by other threat actors. This actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer.\n(WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named \"Vault 7\"by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.\nThe first full part of the series, \"Year Zero\", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.\nRecently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \"zero day\"exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\n\"Year Zero\"introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \"zero day\"weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.",

The overall goal behind this campaign was to maintain access to the target network for espionage.\nThe threat actor achieved remarkable persistence by establishing and maintaining multiple footholds within the victim company\u2019s environment. One of the mechanisms utilized for persistence was a legacy F5 BIG-IP appliance, which was exposed to the internet and which the threat actor leveraged as an internal Command and Control (C&C).\nAfter one foothold was discovered and remediated, the threat actor swiftly pivoted to another, demonstrating agility and adaptability in evading detection.\nThe threat actor exploited various entry points across the victim\u2019s network infrastructure, indicating a comprehensive understanding of the target\u2019s environment.",

       "description":"In May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we looked into the file, we quickly found out that the inner-workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information.\nDuring the course of our research, we noticed that we were not the only ones to have found the operation. Researchers from Bitdefender also released an analysis of one of the samples in a blogpost. Although something had already been published, we decided to do something different with the data we acquired. The following month, we released a private report on our Threat Intelligence Portal to alert our clients about this newly discovered operation and began writing YARA rules in order to catch more samples. We decided to call the operation \u201cViceLeaker\u201d, because of strings and variables in its code.",

Below are key findings identified while researching Viking Spider activity.\n\n\u2022 Viking Spider is the first ransomware attacker to install their own virtual machine (VM) into victim environments. They use this VM to evade detection, and they also use it as a launch point to execute the attack.\n\n\u2022 The gang is the first to use Facebook ads to pressure victims into paying the ransom.\n\u2022 Viking Spider outsources call centers in India to contact victims asking them to pay the ransom or risk data exposure.\n\n\u2022 Viking Spider uses Managed Service Provider (MSP) software to deliver malware and hacktools as well as provide remote access into victim environments.\n\n\u2022 Viking Spider is one of the few gangs who conduct DDoS attacks alongside ransom attacks to pressure victims to pay. Another Cartel gang first used this tactic, but Viking Spider quickly adopted it for their uses as well.\n\n\u2022 Viking Spider uses social media such as Twitter to shame non-paying victims publicly.",

Void Arachne\u2019s campaign involves the use of malicious MSI files that contain legitimate software installer files for artificial intelligence (AI) software as well as other popular software. The malicious Winos payloads are bundled alongside nudifiers and deepfake pornography-generating AI software, voice-and-face-swapping AI software, zh-CN (Simplified Chinese) language packs, the simplified Chinese version of Google Chrome, and Chinese-marketed virtual private networks (VPNs), such as LetsVPN and QuickVPN. During the process of installation, a Winos backdoor is also installed, which could also lead to full system compromise.",

The group does not try to wriggle out of a difficult position by justifying its business, nor is it involved in lawsuits against anybody attempting to report on their activities. Instead, this group is quite open about what it does: breaking into email accounts and social media accounts for money. This threat actor is also involved in selling highly sensitive personal data like cell tower phone logs, passenger flight records, banking data, and passport details.",

The threat actor behind WIP26 has been targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East. WIP26 is characterized by the abuse of public Cloud infrastructure \u2013 Microsoft 365 Mail, Microsoft Azure, Google Firebase, and Dropbox \u2013 for malware delivery, data exfiltration, and C2 purposes.\n\nThe WIP26 activity is initiated by precision targeting of employees through WhatsApp messages that contain Dropbox links to a malware loader. Tricking employees into downloading and executing the loader ultimately leads to the deployment of backdoors that leverage Microsoft 365 Mail and Google Firebase instances as C2 servers. We refer to these backdoors as CMD365 and CMDEmber, respectively. The main functionality of CMD365 and CMDEmber is to execute attacker-provided system commands using the Windows command interpreter.",

It is considered unsophisticated by the fact that the scripts are unobtrusive, communications go unencrypted by HTTP, they use Powershell (increasingly monitored), and so on. Despite this apparently unsophisticated modus operandi compared to other actors, they manage to infect their victims and carry out their objectives. In addition, as will be seen during the report, the detection rate of some of the scripts in December 2018 by the main antivirus manufacturers is low, an aspect that must be highlighted. We must be aware that once these scripts are executed, it is when the behavior analysis of many solutions will detect them, but this fact has not been studied by LAB52.\n\nThis actor in all the artifacts analyzed shows his victims a decoy document in Arabic with different themes.",

       "description":"(Dragos) Dragos identified the WASSONITE activity group following a malware intrusion at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) nuclear facility in India. After further investigation, Dragos observed WASSONITE tools and behaviors targeting multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities including electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and organizations involved in space-centric research. WASSONITE has been active since at least 2018.\n\nWASSONITE targeting focuses on Asian entities, largely in India, as well as possibly Japan and South Korea. At this time, WASSONITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive capability. All the activity represents Stage 1 ICS kill-chain: access operations within IT networks.\n\nWASSONITE operations rely on deploying DTrack malware for remote access to victim machines, capturing credentials via Mimikatz and publicly available tools, and utilizing system tools to transfer files and move laterally within the enterprise system. Researchers first disclosed DTrack in late September 2019, and identified the tool targeting Indian financial institutions and research centers. DTrack is loosely connected to an earlier observed malware family, ATMDTrack, used for robbing ATM machines.\n\nThird-party security firms associate DTrack and its related malware to the Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima. Dragos also associates the activity group Covellite to Lazarus Group. However, while COVELLITE is also linked to broader Lazarus activity, this group leveraged substantially different capabilities and infrastructure to pursue a target set that does not overlap with observed WASSONITE activity.",

       "description":"(Symantec) A corporate espionage group has compromised a string of major corporations over the past three years in order to steal confidential information and intellectual property. The gang, which Symantec calls Butterfly, is not-state sponsored, rather financially motivated. It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks.\n\nButterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target.\n\nThis group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information.

WildCard has since expanded its reach, creating sophisticated malware variants disguised as legitimate software, and a recently developed malware called \u2018RustDown,\u2019 written in Rust for potential operational advantages. Connections to Operation Electric Powder indicate WildCard\u2019s advanced capabilities with a focus on critical sectors within Israel. While we\u2019ve begun to understand WildCard\u2019s tactics and methods, their precise identity is still enigmatic, demanding deeper analysis and collaboration within the infosec community.",

       "description":"(SentinelLabs) The Winter Vivern Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a noteworthy yet relatively underreported group that operates with pro-Russian objectives. DomainTools initially publicized the group in early 2021, naming it based on an initial command-and-control beacon URL string \u201cwintervivern,\u201d which is no longer in use. Subsequently, Lab52 shared additional analysis several months later, identifying new activity associated with Winter Vivern.\n\nThe group has avoided public disclosure since then, until recent attacks targeting Ukraine. A part of a Winter Vivern campaign was reported in recent weeks by the Polish CBZC, and then the Ukraine CERT as UAC-0114. In this activity, CERT-UA and the CBZC collaborated on the release of private technical details which assisted in our research to identify a wider set of activity on the threat actor, in addition to new victims and previously unknown specific technical details. Overall, we find that the Winter Vivern APT is a resource-limited but highly creative group that shows restraint in the scope of their attacks. Our analysis indicates that Winter Vivern activity aligns closely with global objectives that support the interests of Belarus and Russia\u2019s governments.\n\nAlso see MoustachedBouncer.",

It\u2019s also important to note that Google Chrome has a special security feature called Win32k lockdown. This security feature eliminates the whole win32k attack surface by disabling access to win32k syscalls from inside Chrome processes. Unfortunately, Win32k lockdown is only supported on machines running Windows 10. So, it\u2019s fair to assume that Operation WizardOpium targeted users running Windows 7.",

These attacks were conducted by a previously unknown espionage group that we have named Worok and that has been active since at least 2020. Worok\u2019s toolset includes a C++ loader CLRLoad, a PowerShell backdoor PowHeartBeat, and a C# loader PNGLoad that uses steganography to extract hidden malicious payloads from PNG files.\n\nActivity times and toolset indicate possible ties with TA428, but we make this assessment with low confidence.",

It has attracted very little public attention, with the exception of an advisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group compromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nIn this paper, we present our analysis of this nine-year-long espionage campaign, active since 2011, but which apparently went dark in February 2020.\n\nWith its primary purpose seemingly being cyber espionage, this group stole documents and other sensitive files, such as victims\u2019 mailboxes. These outcomes were achieved through the use of the XDSpy malware ecosystem, composed of at least seven components: XDDown, XDRecon, XDList, XDMonitor, XDUpload, XDLoc and XDPass. As our research has not uncovered links with any previously known APT groups, we have attributed this malware toolset to a previously unknown group.",

The threat actors behind ZooPark infect Android devices using several generations of malware we label from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version deployed in 2017.\n\nThe preferred infection vector for ZooPark is waterhole attacks. We found several news websites that have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves malicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include \u201cKurdistan referendum\u201d, \u201cTelegramGroups\u201d and \u201cAlnaharegypt news\u201d, among others.\n\nTarget profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.",

       "description":"(Palo Alto) Between May and June 2019, Unit 42 observed previously unknown tools used in the targeting of transportation and shipping organizations based in Kuwait.\n\nThe first known attack in this campaign targeted a Kuwait transportation and shipping company in which the actors installed a backdoor tool named Hisoka. Several custom tools were later downloaded to the system in order to carry out post-exploitation activities. All of these tools appear to have been created by the same developer. We were able to collect several variations of these tools including one dating back to July 2018.\n\nThe developer of the collected tools used character names from the anime series Hunter x Hunter, which is the basis for the campaign name \u201cxHunt.\u201d The names of the tools collected include backdoor tools Sakabota, Hisoka, Netero and Killua. These tools not only use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels, but certain variants of these tools use DNS tunneling or emails to communicate with their C2 as well. While DNS tunneling as a C2 channel is fairly common, the specific method in which this group used email to facilitate C2 communications has not been observed by Unit 42 in quite some time. This method uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) and stolen credentials to create email \u201cdrafts\u201d to communicate between the actor and the tool. In addition to the aforementioned backdoor tools, we also observed tools referred to as Gon and EYE, which provide the backdoor access and the ability to carry out post-exploitation activities.",
